    This is my developer story.
     In my early years, I heard an argument people were narrating about unbelievable nature of computer.
    I have taken computer class while I was in University in the course entitled “ Introduction to computer.”
    I have attended certification program in basics of computer at college level for three months .
    In my careers , I have applied  basic skills of computer for multi purposes in academic careers.
    While I was in Ethiopia , my friends told me to take certification in Css, HTML, and Java but I did not attended the class hence I thought they have not direct relation with my academic careers.
    In my two years stay in USA, I have grasped the advantage  of being certified in web page development from the people who have been working in this area.
    I have highly interested in coding, database as well as web page development hence i hope it will create further opportunities for work as well as professional development.
    I am unlucky lucky to attend class with respected and professional instructor and webpage developer Brenton Strine.
